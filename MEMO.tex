	We chose to elaborate on the process diagram subject in the Business Model section 3.1.2 of the Accounting Architecture document. We added information concerning different types of flowcharts along with an example of the different shapes used within these charts. We decided to discuss the top-down flowchart which is a very simple chart that can be built upon; the deployment flowchart which is a matrix that lists the participants of a process along with their respective responsibilities; and the detailed flowchart which provides an in-depth view of the process.
	As the document does not currently expound on this subject matter, we found this to be an important contribution to the document because it is a vital part to the foundation of any processing system. If the initial stages of the creation of the processing system are not completed correctly, this could have a negative impact on the final processing system itself. We believe a common understanding of the concepts which we contributed will help users utilize these resources more efficiently.
